# Working Together - Revised Content

## Header Section
**Persona**: Research, Data Science & Software Engineering Professional  
**Experience**: 20+ years building systems that matter - from demographic discovery to fraud detection  
**Core Impact**: Discovered systematic race coding errors affecting all Black and Asian-American voters, developed ML algorithms improving classification accuracy from 23% to 64%

## Expanded Introduction

I'm a Partner at Siege Analytics with 20+ years solving problems through mathematics and software development. My work spans from discovering systematic demographic coding errors affecting millions of voters to building real-time fraud detection systems processing trillions of records in the $2 trillion political spending sub-economy.

I've built redistricting platforms used by thousands of analysts nationwide, achieved 87% prediction accuracy vs. industry standard of 71%, and saved organizations $4.7M through algorithmic innovations. My trigonometric algorithms for boundary estimation have enabled smaller nonprofits to conduct sophisticated analysis previously available only to well-funded organizations.

**Recent highlights include:**
- Expert testimony and press briefings on electoral data integrity
- Real-time FEC analysis systems detecting money laundering across billions of records daily
- Longitudinal data analysis methods improving segmentation accuracy by 34% and survey incidence rates by 28%
- Multi-tenant data warehouse (Civic Graph) serving tens of polling firms, creating $1B+ dataset foundation

*I've dealt with the board room and the back room. Let's work together.*

## How I Work - Philosophy

[Keep existing philosophical content about workplace culture, but add:]

**Technical Philosophy**: "If you want to do analysis, you have to build systems." I believe in building robust, scalable solutions that democratize access to sophisticated analytics.

**Research Ethics**: Having worked with sensitive demographic data affecting millions of voters, I maintain the highest standards for data privacy, algorithmic fairness, and transparent methodology.

**Collaboration**: From UNICEF and IFRC to progressive campaigns and Fortune 500 companies, I adapt my communication style to diverse stakeholders while maintaining technical rigor.

## Contact & Collaboration

For commercial, humanitarian, NGO, or government work, please contact me through the [Contact Page](contact-link).

**Current Focus**: Building systems that matter - whether it's detecting fraud in the $2 trillion political spending sub-economy, improving demographic accuracy for electoral integrity, or democratizing access to sophisticated geospatial analysis.

*I'd love to work with you. Be in touch!*
